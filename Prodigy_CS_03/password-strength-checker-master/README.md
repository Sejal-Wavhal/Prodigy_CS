# Password Strength Checker

## Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based password strength checker. It evaluates passwords based on several security criteria, such as length, the inclusion of numbers, special characters, and both uppercase and lowercase letters. This tool serves as a basic demonstration of password security principles in the realm of cybersecurity.

## Features
- Checks if the password meets the minimum length requirement.
- Verifies the presence of digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters.
- Outputs the strength of the password
